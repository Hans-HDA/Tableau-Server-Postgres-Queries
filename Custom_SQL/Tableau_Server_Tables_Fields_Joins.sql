Pulled Tableau Server 2018.3.4
https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/data_dictionary.html

How to use this File:
1)  Do a search using CTRL-F for the table you are interested in, ie: 'Table workbooks'
2)  Copy the desired fields from the SELECT and paste into you query tool of choice
3)  Copy the desired joins from the FROM and paste into you query tool of choice
4)  Do additional searches using CTRL-F for additional tables ie: 'Table users'
5)  Add the desired SELECT fields from those tables to your SELECT statement
6)  Add addtional commas to fields as needed in your SELECT
7)  Run your query

Known Issues:
* Some tables join to the same table twice, like '_views_stats' with 'users'
  **  In these cases you will have to rename the second table alias to a number of your choosing

* It is possible some fields do not exist which are present in the SELECT statements
  **  If found just remove them from your query

* Be sure to check if an INNER join or LEFT join is correct
  **  It's possible for rows to drop off where it is wrong
  **  If one is found please let me know as I will need to update the join list used to print out this file
